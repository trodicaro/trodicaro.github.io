Best practices associated with using classes vs ids:

* Use class for multiple items with same formatting and id for one unique item on page with its own settings

* Use the class and id inside proper type HTML tags rather than div tags (eg: <!-- <ul class="shopping list"> --> vs <!-- <div class="shopping list"> -->)

* Remember the priority of selectors increases like so: type -> class -> id 
 
* Be mindful of use of space in selectors (or the lack of thereof)
