        Version control is software that keeps track of changes in your work.

        For each commit command Git stores a reference number (HEAD) that is kept in the log and can be used to retreive the info.

        GitHub is one of the online services that uses Git version control. It serves as both work-in-teams platform and storage/showcase site. It facilitates work on projects by all the branching and merging features. And it double up as a storage for user's projects. Plus it generates webpages too :)
