        Describe version control: version control is software that keeps track of changes in the work.

          Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code: GitHub is both a work-in-teams and storage/showcase site. It facilitates work on projects by all the branching and merging features. And it double serves as a storage for user's projects. Plus it generates webpages too :)
