  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>Am I one of them?</h2>

    <p>So I'm a woman and a mom and an imigrant. So I guess I am at danger of both being sterotyped and suffering the stereotype threat syndrome. Like it may cross my mind that people around me think at times that I am not technologically savyy enough because, how could I be? I'm a woman and everybody knows that men are best at this kind of stuff. Or that I am not commited enough because I have kids and, that's nature, right? Kids come first. Or the fact that I am an immigrant may make some people weary of my cultural or/and educational fitness.

    <p>In my previous job I was communicating a lot via email and my communication skills have been under severe scrutiny by one of the persons I was working with. It was a very stressful time for me as there have been times when my competency was questioned because of merely my way of writing. I have been stereotyped back then. I knew it and I felt it. And it made my own stereotype threat syndrome even more powerful.

    <p>Also, during my job searches previous to DBC, I have had a hard time to get invited over for interviews. I guess this kind of stereotype falls in the category "You either have it or you don't". My resume might have not been that impressive, but it was really odd that I was never being contacted back. Of all my applications over a span of 6 months, only 2 companies invited me over for an in person interview. I give them kuddos for their courage of considering starting a coder from a more basic level. The other companies just stuck with the safe way of recruiting the people with experience. But they might have missed their best ever CEO :)

    <p>Am I affected by stereotype threat? I think so. And this is even more so magnified by my impostor syndrome (I have it, just hear me talk sometime and I will apologize like 10 times per minute for the stuff that I don't know, though I am aware that I also know so much other stuff). What to do? Mindfulness helps: taking a step back and acknowledging what this is and not let it take over me. Learning more and knowing more helps too :)
