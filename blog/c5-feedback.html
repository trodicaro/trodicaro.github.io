    I don't think I'm honest when I give feedback. It's hard to be, honest it is :) I've gotten away with giving just the positive side of the pair session. The part that would (potentially) help my pair improve got swept away under the rug. Partly because I have a hard time building it so that it's not your typical "sxxt sandwich" and partly because I'm afraid my pair will get mad at me.

    What to do? In real life I really, strongly believe in giving feedback. I give feedback to anyone, anywhere, anytime ... ahem... anyhow (sometimes a little too directly that is). So why is it hard to give feedback after a DBC pair coding session? An ASK feedback that is (Actionable Specific Kind).

    One reason might be the connection solely over the internet. It's already as impersonal as it can be that getting the feedback might be too demoralizing for some (or might indeed offend to the point where they start avoiding you). Like I am very interested to read the feedback I received and I always feel like a little punch in the stomach when someone points out a "to work on" issue.    
    </p>
    Another reasons could be that I'm simply afraid to not be liked. You see, I really want to be liked :) So I guess, I just have to keep in mind that, should I connect with someone, the feedback I give shouldn't make much difference in the "connection" factor (as long as it's ASK).
    <p>
    </p>
    To sum it up: keep trying on giving that feedback. You'll get better at doing it ASK-ly. Do it for the sake of your pair - they will like you still, maybe even appreciate the frankness.
