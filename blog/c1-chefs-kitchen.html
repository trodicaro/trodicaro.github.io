      I loved watching the video on chefs and customers. Partly because it was offering insight as to how DBC started and partly because the analogy was very compelling.

      I like to think of my self as a chef. But I have to admit that I did start the DevBootcamp with the customer mindset. I was surprised to watch the video and realize it, but I am happy I am aware of it now and can opt to make the switch and make it "My Bootcamp" :)

      While Shareef was describing the first devbootcamp ever to take place, I could picture out the team of people and the "let's do this" spirit of the group. I have always been puzzled by how the DBC alumni's seem to share a special camaraderie and I now begin to see that it's through this "pushing through this together" effort that this bond is born.
