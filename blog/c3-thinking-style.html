      Thinking style: turns out my learning style is a blend of 3 predominant styles and less of a 4th one - the Abstract Random: I am not much of an idea generator or fantasizer, but I do thrive in not so organized and more independent formats. 
    </p>

    <p>
    	Generally my ability of learning new things is pretty good, but I have had the hardest time to get back to coding. I've been pondering for a while now as to what the blocks are and what I could to to improve the process - I ain't giving up here :)
    </p>
    <p>
    	One major impediment is my going into “rabbit holes” :) . There is a lot of learning to that, but it tends to hinder my productivity.

			EG: check <a href="https://trodicaro.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/places-i-got-stuck-and-how-i-got-out/">the places I got stuck</a>. Or that one time when I was bugged that a symlink was showing an undesired bin folder in my Home directory, and, in attempting to remove that, I deleted the /bin aka the whole operating system. Luckily I had backups on everything ... cause I know me :D. Also, way to learn the difference between using or not using the "/"!

		<p>
			Also, I procrastinate in my work because of fear of the unknown (like if I don't know what's in the curriculum I might avoid to start working on it for fear of it being too hard).
		</p>

		<p>
			Yet, another reason I haven't been very productive working on my own has been my inability to stay away from Gmail and FB. I've been battling with this for about an year now and I've gotten better at it, so hopefully that will be one reason less to worry about.
