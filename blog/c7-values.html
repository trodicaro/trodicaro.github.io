    <p>During my schooling years up to my senior year I've been awarded first in class award (well, except for the 7th grade when a colleague snatched it from me, but I showed her the following year :D). This was the "achievement" part of my life. To date, I still have great achievements (eg: DevBootcamp), but it is all thanks to the foundation laid during my schooling years. Here's a goofy proof of those times:

    <p>During my college years I was fortunate to find about a great hiking group - <a href="http://ursultrubadur.org/">The Troubadour Bear</a> -  and I travelled a lot with them. These were the most adventurous days of my life. The picture below is just one of the dozens of trips we took:

    <p>Adult life came around and first serious job with it :). I was surprised to discover that I thrive in an unstructured environment which offered me a lot of initiative taking and decision making opportunities. I had entered the "Accountability" phase of my life. Here's a pic for you to check:

    <p>What lies ahead of me? Looming over is the fearsome world of <code>coders</code> :). I shied away from it once (I majored in programming in high-school, but followed the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">trend of womens quiting the coding world</a>). I have my self confidence ... and the pictures I put above to remind me that I am strong and will make it. Wouldn't hurt though if you wished me luck too ;) .
