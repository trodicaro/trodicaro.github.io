Subject ideas:
A. challenges of the work on the move 
  - proper place to work
  - internet connexion
  - focus
  - time zones
  - sightseeing and exploring the place vs work => mastery of your schedule

B. conflict: what not to do
  - be a passive-aggressive beach (applies equally to men and women): 
    - pretend to not hear what other is saying, doing
    - making noises to cover the other (bang stuff on desk/table, croon, whistle, put on headphones)

    - fixes: 
      - having a journal is your friend: you can have a journal of happiness (- 3 gratitudes, positive journaling - from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJsdqxnZb0). You can also have a journal of your behavior
      - be assertive not aggressive

  - pound with questions and/or requests when other is visibly bothered; drop it for now. Get back at a later and more opportune moment
  - yell
  - get mad
  - throw: "You are wrong". Instead rephrase with "I feel judged when you say that".
  - include "always", "never". It is probably not true and it only makes your discustion partner more angry
  - use "I don't want to", "Cause I say so". Rather take a deep breath and try to give one best reason why you (don't) want a particular thing
