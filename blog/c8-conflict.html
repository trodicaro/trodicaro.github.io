    <p>I have to handle conflict Every.Single.Day. I mean it. Some days I am successful than others :) In attempting to analyze what makes a conflict happen or what nips it in the bud, I've noticed a few case behaviors that the people in conflict tend to do. I will share my observations with you, along with possible fixes:
    <ul>
      
      <li>Passive-aggressiveness: one might be aware that he/she is doing it, or it might just be a way he/she responds (not a good way, but his/her way). Could look something like: 
          <ul>
          
            <li>pretend to not hear what other is saying, doing</li>
          
            <li>making noises to cover the other (bang stuff on desk/table, croon, whistle, put on headphones)</li>
          
            <li>say stuff that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/passive-aggressive-diaries/201011/10-things-passive-aggressive-people-say"></a> passive aggressive people say. Eg: <q>Fine, whatever</q> or <q>I'm not mad</q></li>
          
          </ul>
          
          <p>Possible fixes:</p>

          <ul>
          
            <li>Start paying attention to your own passive-aggressive behaviors as well as your peers and resolve to choose a better way to handle. Some really good tips are in this <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/26/stop-being-passive-aggressive-behavior-signs-_n_5515877.html"> article.</a></li>

            <li>Journaling is your friend.</a> Observing and jotting down the passive aggressive incidents can help with identifying a pattern and adopting an appropriate fix going forward.</li>

          </ul>

      </li>

      <li>Pound the ohter party with questions and/or requests when other is visibly bothered. Best would be to drop whatever the issue for the moment. Get back at a later and less heated moment
      </li>

      <li>Issue strong accusations. Eg <q>You are wrong</q>. Instead rephrase with <q>I statements</q> like <q> I feel judged when you say that</q>
      </li>

      <li>Throw words like <q>always</q> and <q>never</q> in our statements. It is probably not true and it only serves the purpose escalate the conflict. Stick with referring to the present situation only.
      </li>

      <li>Say stuff like <q>I don't want to</q> or <q>Cause I say so</q>. Rather, take a deep breath and try to give one best reason why you (don't) want a particular thing. 
      </li>

      <li>Most dangerous behavior that can occur is letting the conflict escalate to yelling and/or physical aggression. Conflict resolution theory advises to <a href="http://www.mtstcil.org/skills/assert-5.html">use assertiveness instead of aggressiveness</a>         
      </li>

      </ul>
