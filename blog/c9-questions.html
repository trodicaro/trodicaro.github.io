    <p>I have yet to post a question on StackOverflow or such sites. Partly because I am usually able to find an answer via a quick google search, but partly because my impostor syndrome won't let me: what if my question is not good enough? What if it's silly and laughable? Nah, I'm better off struggling on my own :D
    </p>
    <p>Well if (or better yet, when) I post my first question on StackOverflow, I will make sure to keep Eric Steven Raymond's <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">guide on <q>How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</q></a> handy.
    </p> A couple of the pieces of advice that we could all use:
    <ul>
      <li>Google your answer first (I guess I'm doing somting right...). Chances are there's a thread out there somewhere answering your question.</li>
      <li>Choose your forum carefully: don't post a beginners question on an advanced forum.</li>
      <li>Use titles with meaningful, to the point content</li>
      <li>Make it easy to reply: create a reply-to header in your mail agent</li>
    </ul>
