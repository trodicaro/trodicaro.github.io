<body>
<p>Hashes are pairs of elements. I like to think of them as children walking in pairs during a school trip.<p>

<p>Defining hashes:</p>

<pre>A. 
<code>my_info = {}
my_info[:name] = "Rodica"
my_info[:hometown] = "Braila"
my_info[:age] = 34</code>


<pre>B.
<code>my_info = {:name => "Rodica", :hometown => "Braila", :age => 34}</code>

<p>Arrays are like the columns in a spreadsheet:</p>
