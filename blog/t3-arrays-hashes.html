	<title>Arrays and Hashes</title>

<body>

<p>1. Hashes are pairs of elements. I like to think of them as children walking in pairs during a school trip.</p>

<p>Initialize hashes:</p>

<pre>a. 
<code>my_info = {}
my_info[:name] = "Rodica"
my_info[:hometown] = "Braila"
my_info[:age] = 34</code></pre>


<pre>b.
<code>my_info = {:name => "Rodica", :hometown => "Braila", :age => 34}</code></pre>
 
<p>2. Arrays are like neatly lined up cubbies where first one is indexed with 0</p>


<p>Initialize arrays:</p>

<pre>a.
<code>class_roster = []
class_roster[0] = "Jovanni"
class_roster[1] = "Sebastian"
class_roster[2] = "Keira"</code></pre>


<pre>b.
<code>class_roster = ["Jovanni", "Sebastian", "Keira"]</code>
</pre>
